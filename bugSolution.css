The solution involves carefully managing specificity.  If we want the `p` element within the `.container` to always inherit the color from its parent, we might use a different approach or add better specificity:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  color: red; /*Override the div color*/
}

.container p {
  color: inherit; /* Inherits from the parent container */
}

.container p.special {
  color: purple; /* Still overrides the inherited red color */
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the `p` elements consistently inherit the color from their parent container, unless overridden by a more specific rule like `.container p.special`.
