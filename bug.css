The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container p.special {
  color: purple;
}
```

The issue arises when trying to style elements based on inheritance and class specificity.  The `.container p` selector overrides the inherited `color: blue` from the `div` element and applies `color: green`.  However, `.container p.special` is even more specific, correctly overriding the `color: green` with `color: purple`.
